# README-Generator

## Description
A generator that dynamically produces a high-quality ReadMe file directly from the command line. 

## Tasks Completed 
* Modularlized code into multiple files.
* Wrote code using ES6+ concepts, such as let, const, and arrow functions.
* Use npm (Node Package Manager) to initialize a project and install and import Node.js modules.
* Built an interactive command-line application that processes user input using a third-party Node.js module.
* Use string literals to dynamically generate markdown form the command line.
